# Music21 MCP Server Validation Report

## üö® Critical Findings

### 1. MCP Server Architecture Issues
- **STDIO Mode**: ‚ùå Not properly implemented (crashes with `ValueError: a coroutine was expected`)
- **HTTP Mode**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Starts but not standard MCP protocol
- **Tool Discovery**: ‚ùì Cannot test without working server
- **Client Integration**: ‚ùå Cannot connect via standard MCP clients

### 2. Core Functionality Status

#### ‚úÖ Working Features
- **Score Storage**: Basic in-memory storage works
- **Key Analysis**: Detects keys (but with low confidence on real music)
- **Corpus Access**: Can load music21 corpus files (363 Bach works found)
- **Performance**: Fast analysis (<0.02s for 100 measures)

#### ‚ùå Broken Features
- **Text Import**: Fails with "Invalid source format"
- **Chord Analysis**: Fails with `'Chord' object has no attribute 'pitchesChr'`
- **Import from String**: Source type detection not working
- **Real Music Analysis**: Returns 0 chords for Bach chorales

### 3. Accuracy Issues with Real Music

#### Bach Chorale BWV 66.6 Test
- **Expected Key**: F# minor ‚úÖ (Correctly detected)
- **Confidence**: 0.31 ‚ùå (Very low - should be >0.8)
- **Chord Detection**: 0 chords ‚ùå (Should find ~30-50 chords)
- **Voice Leading**: Not tested (chord analysis prerequisite failed)

#### Performance Metrics
- **Small pieces (<100 bars)**: ‚úÖ <0.1s (Excellent)
- **Memory usage**: Not tested
- **Concurrent operations**: Not tested
- **Memory leaks**: Not tested

### 4. Test Quality Issues

The synthetic test data in integration tests masks real problems:
```python
# This works:
upper_notes = ['C5', 'D5', 'E5', 'F5', 'G5', 'F5', 'E5', 'D5', 'C5']

# But real Bach chorales fail:
chord_result = await analyze_chord_progressions("bach_chorale")
# Returns: {'total_chords': 0}  # Should be ~30-50
```

## üî¥ Root Causes Identified

### 1. Import Function Issues
- Source parameter expects specific format, not plain string
- Type detection logic is broken
- Text parsing not implemented despite being advertised

### 2. Chord Analysis Problems
- Uses `pitchesChr` attribute that doesn't exist in music21
- Should use `pitchNames` or `pitchClasses` instead
- Indicates code was not tested with actual music21 objects

### 3. Low Analysis Confidence
- Key detection algorithm may not handle polyphonic music well
- Needs better handling of modulations and chromatic content
- Bach chorales often have brief tonicizations affecting detection

### 4. MCP Protocol Implementation
- FastMCP `run()` method usage incorrect
- Missing proper STDIO transport setup
- No actual MCP protocol message handling

## üìä Validation Statistics

| Category | Passed | Failed | Success Rate |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Core Functions | 4 | 2 | 67% |
| Real Music Tests | 1 | 3 | 25% |
| MCP Protocol | 0 | 4 | 0% |
| **Overall** | **5** | **9** | **36%** |

## üéØ Required Fixes (Priority Order)

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. **Fix MCP server startup** - Implement proper STDIO transport
2. **Fix chord analysis** - Replace `pitchesChr` with correct attribute
3. **Fix import function** - Handle text/string input correctly
4. **Improve key detection confidence** - Better algorithm for polyphonic music

### High Priority
5. **Add real validation tests** - Replace synthetic data with corpus examples
6. **Implement error recovery** - Graceful handling of analysis failures
7. **Add performance benchmarks** - Memory usage and concurrency tests

### Medium Priority
8. **Documentation** - Update to reflect actual capabilities
9. **Integration tests** - Test with real MCP clients
10. **Cross-validation** - Compare with other music analysis tools

## üö¶ Recommendation

**DO NOT DEPLOY** in current state. The server has fundamental issues that prevent it from functioning as an MCP server. Additionally, core music analysis features have significant accuracy problems with real music.

### Minimum Viable Product Requires:
1. Working MCP STDIO mode
2. Accurate chord detection (>90% accuracy)
3. High-confidence key detection (>0.8 for clear keys)
4. Successful round-trip import/export
5. All basic tests passing with real music

## üìà Path Forward

1. **Phase 0.5: Foundation Repair** (1-2 weeks)
   - Fix MCP protocol implementation
   - Fix broken analysis functions
   - Add comprehensive real music tests

2. **Phase 0.6: Accuracy Improvement** (1-2 weeks)
   - Improve analysis algorithms
   - Cross-validate with known analyses
   - Performance optimization

3. **Phase 0.7: Integration & Polish** (1 week)
   - Test with Claude Desktop
   - Documentation update
   - Error handling improvements

Only after these fixes should development continue to Phase 3 (Creative Tools).
