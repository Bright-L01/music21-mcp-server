## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow
```python
# Import a score
await import_score("bach_chorale", "bach/bwv66.6")

# Analyze it
key = await analyze_key("bach_chorale")
harmony = await analyze_harmony("bach_chorale")
patterns = await find_patterns("bach_chorale")

# Generate variations
harmonized = await harmonize_melody("melody", style="bach")
counterpoint = await generate_counterpoint("melody", species="first")
```

### Advanced Workflow
```python
# Deep analysis
voice_leading = await analyze_voice_leading(
    "bach_chorale",
    style_period="common_practice"
)

# Style learning and generation
await import_score("bach_invention", "bach/invention_1")
style_analysis = await analyze_style("bach_invention")
new_piece = await imitate_style(
    style_source="bach_invention",
    generation_length=32
)

# Educational use
harmonization = await harmonize_melody(
    "student_melody",
    style="classical",
    include_explanations=True
)
