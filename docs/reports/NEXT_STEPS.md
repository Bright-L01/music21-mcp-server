# Next Steps for Production Readiness

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ All features implemented (Phases 1-3 complete)
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline passing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Numpy dependency issue in test environment
- ‚è≥ Real-world IMSLP validation pending
- üìä Estimated success rate: 92% (need 95%)

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Numpy Environment Issue
```bash
# Create fresh conda environment
conda create -n music21-mcp python=3.10
conda activate music21-mcp

# Install with conda (better for numpy/scipy on Mac)
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib
pip install -e .

# Test
python tests/test_core_validation.py
```

### 2. Download IMSLP Test Files
1. Use the generated instructions in `IMSLP_DOWNLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
2. Download at least 20 files covering different periods
3. Save to `test_corpus/imslp/` organized by period

### 3. Run Validation Suite
```bash
# After downloading IMSLP files
python tests/real_world_validation.py

# Run production readiness check
python tests/production_readiness_suite.py
```

### 4. Analyze Results
- Review compatibility matrix
- Identify tools below 95% success rate
- Focus fixes on most common failure patterns

## Expected Outcomes

If numpy issue is resolved and tests run successfully:
- **Best case**: Already at 95%+ ‚Üí Production ready! 
- **Likely case**: 92-94% ‚Üí Need 1-2 days of targeted fixes
- **Worst case**: <90% ‚Üí Need to address fundamental issues

## Priority Fixes (If Needed)

1. **Performance Issues**
   - Add timeout handling
   - Implement result caching
   - Optimize large score processing

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Better error messages
   - Graceful degradation
   - Input validation

3. **Tool-Specific Issues**
   - Focus on tools with lowest success rates
   - Add recovery mechanisms
   - Improve error handling

## Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ All validation tests pass in fresh environment
- ‚úÖ 95%+ success rate on IMSLP corpus
- ‚úÖ No critical failures on standard repertoire
- ‚úÖ Performance within acceptable bounds
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for unsupported features
