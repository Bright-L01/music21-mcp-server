# Phase 2: Advanced Analysis Features

## 1. Harmonic Analysis
- Functional harmony analysis with Roman numerals
- Cadence detection and classification
- Non-chord tone identification
- Secondary dominants and borrowed chords
- Voice leading analysis with parallel detection

## 2. Pattern Recognition
- Melodic sequence detection
- Rhythmic pattern identification
- Motivic analysis with transformations
- Phrase structure analysis
- Contour and interval patterns

## 3. Voice Leading Analysis
- Parallel fifths/octaves detection
- Voice crossing identification
- Spacing and range checking
- Style-specific rule checking
- Voice independence metrics

# Phase 3: Creative Tools

## 1. Intelligent Harmonization
- Multiple style options: classical, jazz, pop, modal
- Voice leading optimization
- Constraint support (diatonic only, specific progressions)
- Explanations for harmonic choices
- 2-4 voice arrangements

## 2. Counterpoint Generation
- All five species of counterpoint
- Strict and relaxed rule sets
- Above/below cantus firmus options
- Canon generation
- Educational explanations

## 3. Style Imitation
- Learn from example pieces
- Pre-defined composer styles (Bach, Mozart, Chopin, Debussy)
- Markov chain-based generation
- Multi-parametric style modeling
- Style adherence analysis
