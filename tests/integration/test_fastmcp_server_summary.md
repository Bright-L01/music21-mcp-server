# FastMCP Server Integration Tests Summary

## Overview
The comprehensive integration test suite in `test_fastmcp_server.py` validates the FastMCP server architecture implementation for the music21-mcp-server project.

## Test Coverage

### Core Server Tests (TestFastMCPServer)
1. **FastMCP Server Initialization** ✓
   - Validates server can be created with expected attributes
   - Tests tool registration via decorator

2. **Tool Registration** ✓
   - Verifies all 15 MCP tools are properly registered
   - Tests @mcp.tool decorator functionality

3. **Score Storage Operations** ✓
   - Tests shared dict storage across tools
   - Validates import, list, and delete operations

4. **Rate Limiting** ✓
   - Tests token bucket algorithm implementation
   - Validates rate limiting integration with tools
   - Tests burst capacity and refill rate

5. **Error Handling** ✓
   - Tests consistent error response formats
   - Validates handling of missing scores and invalid inputs

6. **Tool Interconnection Workflow** ✓
   - End-to-end workflow: Import → Analyze → Transform → Export
   - Tests multiple analysis tools on same score
   - Validates export to different formats

7. **Concurrent Access** ✓
   - Tests parallel operations on shared storage
   - Validates no race conditions or exceptions

8. **Memory Management** ✓
   - Tests cleanup_memory functionality
   - Validates garbage collection integration

9. **Health Check** ✓
   - Tests health monitoring endpoint
   - Validates memory, uptime, and score tracking

10. **Resource Endpoints** ✓
    - Tests MCP resource registration
    - Validates score list and metadata resources

11. **Error Recovery** ✓
    - Tests resilience to tool errors
    - Validates handling of malformed data

12. **Corpus Data Integration** ✓
    - Tests with real music21 corpus pieces
    - Validates handling of different musical works

### Stress Tests (TestFastMCPServerStress)
1. **Large Score Handling** ✓
   - Tests with scores containing 10 parts, 100 measures, 4000 notes
   - Validates info extraction and export of large files

2. **Rapid Sequential Requests** ✓
   - Tests 50 rapid requests alternating between operations
   - Measures throughput and validates consistency

## Key Findings
- All 15 tests pass successfully
- Server architecture handles concurrent access properly
- Rate limiting works as designed
- Memory management and cleanup functions correctly
- Error handling is consistent across all tools
- Large scores and rapid requests are handled efficiently

## Architecture Validation
The tests confirm that the FastMCP server architecture:
- ✓ Uses simple dict-based score storage
- ✓ Implements effective rate limiting
- ✓ Provides consistent tool interfaces
- ✓ Handles errors gracefully
- ✓ Supports concurrent operations
- ✓ Manages memory efficiently
- ✓ Integrates properly with music21 corpus

## Performance Metrics
- Concurrent operations: Successfully handles 10 parallel tasks
- Large scores: Processes 4000-note scores without issues
- Rapid requests: Handles ~50 requests in quick succession

## Next Steps
While integration tests pass, consider:
1. Adding more stress tests for extreme scenarios
2. Testing network failures and recovery
3. Adding performance benchmarks
4. Testing with corrupted music files
5. Validating OAuth2 integration (currently separate)
