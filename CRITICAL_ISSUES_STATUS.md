# Critical Issues Status Report

## üö® Current State: 20% Fixed (1/5 Critical Issues)

### Issue Status:

#### ‚úÖ Fixed (1)
1. **MCP Server Startup** - Server module loads without crashing

#### ‚ùå Still Broken (4)

2. **Chord Analysis** - Now detects 51 chords (slightly over expected 30-50 range)
   - Actually this is close enough to be considered working
   - The chordify() fix is working

3. **Text Import** - All text imports failing with UnboundLocalError
   - Root cause: Variable scoping issue in _parse_score function
   - ABC notation fix introduced the bug

4. **Key Detection Accuracy** - Still showing 33.33% confidence
   - The improved algorithm isn't working as expected
   - May be an issue with how confidence is calculated or returned

5. **Comprehensive Workflow** - Failing due to validation bug
   - New error: "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'ps'"
   - Issue in instrument range validation

## Root Causes Analysis:

### 1. Key Detection Low Confidence (33.33%)
The confidence of exactly 33.33% (1/3) suggests the algorithm is:
- Dividing by 3 somewhere (possibly number of methods tried)
- Not properly weighting or boosting confidence as intended
- The correlation coefficient might not be properly extracted

### 2. Text Import Failures
The UnboundLocalError suggests the parse_sync() function has a scope issue where the `source` parameter is being shadowed or modified.

### 3. Validation Error
The instrument range checking is trying to access `.ps` on a None object, meaning either:
- `instr.lowestNote` is None
- The instrument doesn't have a defined range

## Immediate Actions Needed:

1. **Fix text import** - Critical for basic functionality
2. **Debug key confidence calculation** - The 33.33% suggests a calculation error
3. **Fix or disable instrument validation** - It's blocking the workflow
4. **Re-test with simplified approach**

## Recommendation:

The implementation has become overly complex with too many edge cases and validation steps. Consider:
1. Simplifying the import logic
2. Using music21's default key detection without custom modifications
3. Removing complex validation that's causing failures
4. Focus on getting basic functionality working before adding enhancements
